## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Conversation with Memory:
```python
# Start Gemini Code
python main.py

# First message
> "Crie um arquivo test.py"
< "Arquivo test.py criado com sucesso!"

# Second message (remembers context)
> "Adicione uma função hello_world"
< "Adicionando função hello_world ao arquivo test.py que criamos..."
```

### Memory Commands:
```bash
# Check memory status
> memoria

# Show conversation summary
> conversa

# Reset current conversation (keeps long-term memory)
> reset
```

### Health Monitoring:
```bash
# Check project health
> saude

# Run specific health check
python -c "from gemini_code.analysis.refactored_health_monitor import RefactoredHealthMonitor; ..."
```
